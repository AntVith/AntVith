### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Magic

Magic is what I thought coding/software engineering was because of the complex undertone associated with the field.

After learning languages like JavaScript, Python, SQL, HTML, and CSS I now know how to do "magic".

I have worked on full stack web application projects mentioned below for you to take a look at. Feel free to let me know what you think!


* Striverr :computer: -- a freelance tech and software engineering web application modeled off of Fiverr with features in services, bookings, and reviews
* SoundStream :headphones: -- a music sharing app designed after SoundCloud with full music upload functionality to AWS, WaveSurfer technology for music play, and comment and like capabilities
    
I'm also currently buulding with several different languages and frameworks

**AntVith/AntVith** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Imagine the Matrix + The "One Rule" of Fight Club + The Office.

Magic is what I create.

From this magic I have created:

* SoundStream :headphones: -- a music sharing app designed after SoundCloud with full music upload functionality to AWS, WaveSurfer techonology for music play, and comment and like capabilities
    
I'm also currently progressing my skills and knowledge in Python, JavaScript, SQL, HTML, CSS, React, Redux, Flask, Express, and more!
